# Rosterboy

The project is named Rosterboy until a better name is determined.

The goal of this project is to provide an open source alternative to how small businesses manage their rosters.

Traditionally various businesses (small ones in particular) use Excel spreadsheets or Microsoft Word tables to manage their employees' roster schedules.

The problems are:
- There is only one physical copy of the schedule
- Not everyone can view the physical copy (you need to come in to take a picture or memorise it) at all times
- Difficult to change (once printed its generally difficult change)

The aim of this project is to make this process occur on the web so that changes can be made but also that it is viewable across a multitude of platforms.
